# Design Principles

---

## The Act of Design

With the discovery and propagation of common design principles and patterns,
all OOD problems would appear to have been solved.

### Question?

Now that the underlying rules are known, **how hard can designing
object-oriented software be?**

---

## How Design Fails

The first way design fails is due to lack of it.

Programmers initially know little about design.

This is not a deterrent, however, as it is possible to produce
working applications without knowing the first thing about design.

---

### Note about Ruby

This is true of any OO language, but some languages are more susceptible than others,
and an approachable language like **Ruby** is especially vulnerable.

**Ruby is very friendly.**

The language permits nearly anyone to create scripts to
automate repetitive tasks, and an opinionated framework
like Ruby on Rails puts web applications within every
programmer’s reach.

The syntax of the Ruby language is so gentle that anyone blessed with the ability to string
thoughts into logical order can produce working applications.

**Programmers who know nothing about object-oriented design
can be very successful in Ruby.**

---

## Apps that carry the seeds of their own destruction

1. Yes, I can add that feature, **but it will break everything**.<br>
  _Undesigned_
1. No, I can’t add that feature; **it wasn’t designed to do that**.<br>
  _Overdesigned_
1. Well, I can certainly write this, **but it’s not what you**<br>
   **really want and you will eventually be sorry**.<br>
   _Lack of feedback loop_

---

## When to Design

**If Agile is correct**, two other things are also true.

First, there is absolutely no point in doing a Big Up Front
Design (BUFD) (because it cannot possibly be correct).

Second, no one can predict when the application will be done
(because you don’t know in advance what it will eventually do).

# SOLID Code

---

### Designing Classes/Methods with a Single Responsibility

The foundation of an object-oriented system is **the message**,
but the most visible organizational structure is **the class**.

### Design Goals

Your goal is to model your application, using classes,
such that it does what it is supposed to do **right now** and
is also easy to change **later**.

---

## Deciding What Belongs in a Class

The problem is not one of ***technical knowledge*** (**implementation**)
but of ***organization***.

You know how to write the code but not where to put it.

---

## Grouping Methods into Classes

Despite the importance of correctly grouping methods into classes,
at this early stage of your project you cannot possibly get it right.

### You will never know less than you know right now.

---

## Organizing Code to Allow for Easy Changes

Define *easy to change* as:

* changes have no unexpected side effects,

* small changes in requirements require correspondingly small changes in code,

* existing code is easy to reuse,

* the easiest way to make a change is to add code that in itself is easy to change

---

## TRUE – code you should write

* **Transparent**<br>
  The consequences of change should be obvious in the code
  that is changing and in distant code that relies upon it.

* **Reasonable**<br>
  The cost of any change should be proportional to the benefits the change achieves.

* **Usable**<br>
  Existing code should be usable in new and unexpected contexts.

* **Exemplary**<br>
  The code itself should encourage those who change it to perpetuate these qualities.
