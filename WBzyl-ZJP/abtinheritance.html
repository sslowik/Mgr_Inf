# Acquiring behavior thru inheritance

## Chapter 6, POODR2

### [source code for the examples from the book](https://github.com/skmetz/poodr2)

## Understanding Classical Inheritance

* Inheritance is, at its core, **a mechanism for automatic message delegation**.
* It defines a forwarding path for not-understood messages.
* It creates relationships such that, if one object cannot respond
  to a received message, it delegates that message to another.

---

## Other Inheritance Techniques

1. JavaScript has prototypical inheritance.

1. Ruby has modules which also provide a way to share
code via automatic delegation of messages.

## FastFeet sp. z o.o. leads road bike trips

```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :size, :tape_color

*  def initialize(**opts)
*    @size       = opts[:size]
*    @tape_color = opts[:tape_color]
*  end

  # every bike has the same defaults for
  # tire and chain size
  def spares
    {
      chain:        '11-speed',
      tire_size:    '23',
      tape_color:   tape_color
    }
  end
end

bike = Bicycle.new(size: 'M', tape_color: 'red')

puts bike.size # => M

puts bike.spares # => {:chain=>"11-speed", :tire_size=>"23", :tape_color=>"red"}
```

---

## Change

### Imagine that FastFeet begins to lead _mountain bike_ trips.

The new **front_shock** and **rear_shock** variables hold
mountain bike–specific parts.

---

## Embedding Multiple Types

```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :style, :size, :tape_color,
              :front_shock, :rear_shock

  def initialize(**opts)
    @style       = opts[:style]
    @size        = opts[:size]
    @tape_color  = opts[:tape_color]
    @front_shock = opts[:front_shock]
    @rear_shock  = opts[:rear_shock]
  end

  # checking 'style' starts down a slippery slope
  def spares
    if style == :road
      { chain:       '11-speed',
        tire_size:   '23',       # milimeters
        tape_color:  tape_color }
    else
      { chain:       '11-speed',
        tire_size:   '2.1',      # inches
        front_shock: front_shock }
    end
  end
end
```

---

## cont. with _antipattern_

```ruby
bike = Bicycle.new(
  style: :mountain,
  size: 'S',
  front_shock: 'Manitou', rear_shock: 'Fox')

puts bike.spares
# => {:chain=>"11-speed", :tire_size=>"2.1", :front_shock=>"Manitou"}

bike = Bicycle.new(
  style: :road,
  size: 'M',
  tape_color: 'red')

puts bike.spares
# => {:chain=>"11-speed", :tire_size=>"23", :tape_color=>"red"}
```

<!--
If you write careless code where

* the last option is the default (as does the code above),
  an unexpected style will do something but perhaps not what you expect.
* Also, the spares method started out containing embedded default strings;
  some of these strings are now duplicated on each side of the if statement.

The size method still works, spares generally works, but the parts methods are
now unreliable. It’s impossible to predict, for any specific instance of
Bicycle, whether a specific part has been initialized.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle_types

bike = Bicycle.new(
  style: :touring,
  size: 'L',
  rear_shock: 'Fox')

-->

## cont. with _antipattern_

**Bicycle now has more than one *responsibility***, contains things that might
change for different reasons, and cannot be reused as is.

This code contains an **if** statement that checks **an attribute that holds the
category of self** to determine what message to send to **self**.

The style variable effectively divides instances of **Bicycle** into two
different kinds of things.

These two things share a great deal of behavior but differ along the style
dimension.
Some of Bicycle’s behavior applies to all bicycles, some only to road
bikes, and some only to mountain bikes. This single class contains several
different, but related, types.

### This is the exact problem that inheritance solves: that of highly related types that share common behavior but differ along some dimension.

---

## Multiple v. Single Inheritance

If more than one of its parents implements the message, which implementation has
priority? As you might guess, things get complicated quickly.

Many object-oriented languages sidestep these complications by providing single
inheritance, whereby a subclass is allowed only one parent superclass.

Ruby/Java does this; it has single inheritance. A superclass may have many
subclasses, but each subclass is permitted only one superclass.

---

## Message forwarding via classical inheritance takes place between classes

Even if you have never explicitly created a class hierarchy of your own, you use
inheritance.

When you define a new class but do not specify its superclass, Ruby
automatically sets your new class’s superclass to **Object**.

Every class you create is, by definition, a subclass of something.

See p. 113, POODR2, Figure 6.3 for an example.

The fact that unknown messages get delegated up the superclass hierarchy implies
that subclasses are everything their superclasses are, plus **more**.
